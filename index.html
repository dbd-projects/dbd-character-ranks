                <td>Billy's one-hit down is pretty strong because it makes chases go faster. He also has high mobility with
                    his chainsaw, which eliminates the need to slow down the overall game. His ability to go from one side
                    of the map to another in a few short seconds is the most powerful thing you can have in quick paced
                    games.
